A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was created in PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset. Visualizations of the CNN feature maps were used to examine the processing of layers. 

The PyTorch Lightning framework is the core of the project, and Weights and Biases was used to monitor evaluation metrics.

This computer vision project was for the graduate CS class Deep Learning at Portland State University.
